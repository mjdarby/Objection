# Prerequisites

This demo is only tested on Firefox. In particular it does not work on Chrome as it cannot load files on local filesystem.
The Javascript binding works on both Firefox and Chrome and any browser that supports
[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) and [Web Audio Api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API).

Just open the HTML file in Firefox and follow the instructions.
