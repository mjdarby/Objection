# Porcupine Demo in C++ and Qt
This demo was created using Qt Creator. To build and run the program, open the
project using Qt Creator and press the Run button on bottom left.

To run it successfully with the default settings, you will need to generate a keyword file (.ppn) called `keyword.ppn` in root directory. You can refer to the instruction on doing so in README.md under the root directory.
