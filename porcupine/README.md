## Performance

A comparison between accuracy and runtime metrics of Porcupine and two other widely-used libraries, PocketSphinx and
Snowboy, is provided [here](https://github.com/Picovoice/wakeword-benchmark). Compared to the best-performing engine,
Porcupine's standard model is 2.53 times more accurate, 2.6 times faster (on Raspberry Pi 3), and consumes 45% less
memory. 

## Model Variants

Porcupine comes in two different variations: **standard** and **tiny**. The tiny model is specifically designed for
deeply-embedded applications. Its accuracy is slightly lower than the standard model but it consumes considerably less 
resources. Below is the comparison of runtime measurements for different variants of Porcupine on Raspberry Pi3.

| Model Variant | CPU Usage | Memory Usage |
:---: | :---: | :---:
Standard | 7.39% | 1380 KB |
Tiny | 3.42% | 240 KB |

For accuracy comparison of different variants refer to
[benchmark repository](https://github.com/Picovoice/wakeword-benchmark).

## Structure of Repository

Porcupine is shipped as an ANSI C precompiled library. The binary files for supported platforms are located under
[lib/](/lib) and header files are at [include/](/include). Currently, Raspberry Pi, Android, iOS, watchOS, Linux, Mac,
Windows, and modern web browsers are supported.

Bindings are available at [binding/](/binding) to facilitate usage from higher-level languages/platforms. Demo
applications are at [demo/](/demo). When possible, use one of the demo applications as a starting point for your own
implementation.

[tools/](/tools) contains utility programs. Finally, [resources/](/resources) is a placeholder for data used by
various applications within the repository.

Below is a quick walk-through of the repository. For detailed instructions please visit relevant pages. Throughout the
documentation, it is assumed that the current working directory is the root of the repository.

## Running Demo Applications

### Python Demo Application

This [demo application](/demo/python) allows testing Porcupine using computer's microphone. It opens an input audio
stream, monitors it using Porcupine's library, and logs the detection events into the console. Below is an example of
running the demo for hotword **Alexa** from the command line. Replace `${SYSTEM}` with the name of the operating system
on your machine (e.g. linux, mac, windows, or raspberry-pi).

```bash
python demo/python/porcupine_demo.py --keyword_file_paths resources/keyword_files/alexa_${SYSTEM}.ppn
```

### Android Demo Application

Using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) open [demo/android](/demo/android) as an Android
project and then run the application. Note that you need an android phone with developer options enabled connected to
your machine in order to run the application.

### iOS Demo Application

Using [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) open [demo/ios](/demo/ios) and run the application. Note that you need
an iOS device connected to your machine and a valid Apple developer account.

## Creating Keyword Files

Porcupine enables developers to build models for any wake word. This is done using Porcupine's optimizer utility.
It finds optimal model hyper-parameters for a given hotword and stores these parameters in a keyword file.
You could create your own keyword file using the [Porcupine's optimizer](/tools/optimizer) from the command line

```bash
tools/optimizer/${SYSTEM}/${MACHINE}/pv_porcupine_optimizer -r resources/ -w ${WAKE_WORD} \
-p ${TARGET_SYSTEM} -o ${OUTPUT_DIRECTORY}
```

In the above example replace ```${SYSTEM}``` and ```${TARGET_SYSTEM}``` with current and target (runtime) operating
systems (linux, mac, or windows). ```${MACHINE}``` is the CPU architecture of current machine (x86_64 or i386). ```${WAKE_WORD}```
is the chosen wake word. Finally, ```${OUTPUT_DIRECTORY}``` is the output directory where keyword file will be stored.

## Integration

Below are code snippets showcasing how Porcupine can be integrated into different applications.

### C

Porcupine is implemented in ANSI C and therefore can be directly linked to C applications.
[include/pv_porcupine.h](/include/pv_porcupine.h) header file contains relevant information. An instance of Porcupine
object can be constructed as follows.

```c
const char *model_file_path = ... // The file is available at lib/common/porcupine_params.pv
const char *keyword_file_path = ...
const float sensitivity = 0.5;
pv_porcupine_object_t *handle;

const pv_status_t status = pv_porcupine_init(model_file_path, keyword_file_path, sensitivity, &handle);

if (status != PV_STATUS_SUCCESS) {
    // error handling logic
}
```

Sensitivity is the parameter that enables developers to trade miss rate for false alarm. It is a floating number within
[0, 1]. A higher sensitivity reduces miss rate at cost of increased false alarm rate.

Now the `handle` can be used to monitor incoming audio stream. Porcupine accepts single channel, 16-bit PCM audio.
The sample rate can be retrieved using `pv_sample_rate()`. Finally, Porcupine accepts input audio in consecutive chunks
(aka frames) the length of each frame can be retrieved using `pv_porcupine_frame_length()`.

```c
extern const int16_t *get_next_audio_frame(void);

while (true) {
    const int16_t *pcm = get_next_audio_frame();
    bool result;
    const pv_status_t status = pv_porcupine_process(handle, pcm, &result);
    if (status != PV_STATUS_SUCCESS) {
        // error handling logic
    }
    if (result) {
        // detection event logic/callback
    }
}
```

Finally, when done be sure to release resources acquired.

```c
pv_porcupine_delete(handle);
```

### Python

[/binding/python/porcupine.py](/binding/python/porcupine.py) provides a Python binding for Porcupine library. Below is a
quick demonstration of how to construct an instance of it to detect multiple keywords concurrently.

```python
library_path = ... # Path to Porcupine's C library available under lib/${SYSTEM}/${MACHINE}/
model_file_path = ... # It is available at lib/common/porcupine_params.pv
keyword_file_paths = ['path/to/keyword/1', 'path/to/keyword/2', ...]
sensitivities = [0.5, 0.4, ...]
handle = Porcupine(library_path, model_file_path, keyword_file_paths=keyword_file_paths, sensitivities=sensitivities)
```

Sensitivity is the parameter that enables developers to trade miss rate for false alarm. It is a floating number within
[0, 1]. A higher sensitivity reduces miss rate at cost of increased false alarm rate.

When initialized, valid sample rate can be obtained using ```handle.sample_rate```. Expected frame length
(number of audio samples in an input array) is ```handle.frame_length```. The object can be used to monitor
incoming audio as below.

```python
def get_next_audio_frame():
    pass

while True:
    pcm = get_next_audio_frame()
    keyword_index = handle.process(pcm)
    if keyword_index >= 0:
        # detection event logic/callback
        pass
```

Finally, when done be sure to explicitly release the resources as the binding class does not rely on the garbage
collector.

```python
handle.delete()
```

### csharp

[/binding/dotnet/PorcupineCS/Porcupine.cs](/binding/dotnet/PorcupineCS/Porcupine.cs) provides a c# binding for Porcupine library. Below is a
quick demonstration of how to construct an instance of it to detect multiple keywords concurrently.


```csharp
string model_file_path = ... // The file is available at lib/common/porcupine_params.pv
string keyword_file_path = ...
float sensitivity = 0.5;
Porcupine instance;

instance = new Porcupine(model_file_path, keyword_file_path, sensitivity);

if (instance.Status != PicoVoiceStatus.SUCCESS) {
    // error handling logic
}
```

Sensitivity is the parameter that enables developers to trade miss rate for false alarm. It is a floating number within
[0, 1]. A higher sensitivity reduces miss rate at cost of increased false alarm rate.

Now the `instance` can be used to monitor incoming audio stream. Porcupine accepts single channel, 16-bit PCM audio.
The sample rate can be retrieved using `instance.SampleRate()`. Finally, Porcupine accepts input audio in consecutive chunks
(aka frames) the length of each frame can be retrieved using `instance.FrameLength()`.

```csharp
Int16[] GetNextAudioFrame()
{
    ... // some functionality that gets the next frame
}


while (true) {
    Int16[] frame = GetNextAudioFrame();
    bool result;
    PicoVoiceStatus status = instance.Process(pcm, out result);
    if (status != PicoVoiceStatus.SUCCESS) {
        // error handling logic
    }
    if (result) {
        // detection event logic/callback
    }
}
```

Finally, when done we don't need to release the resources ourself, the garbage collector will fix it.
But if you want to do it yourself.

```csharp
instance.Dispose();
```

### Android

There are two possibilities for integrating Porcupine into an Android application.

#### Binding

[Porcupine](/binding/android/porcupine/src/main/java/ai/picovoice/porcupine/Porcupine.java) provides a binding for
Android using [JNI](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jni/). It can be initialized using.

```java
    final String modelFilePath = ... // It is available at lib/common/porcupine_params.pv
    final String keywordFilePath = ...
    final float sensitivity = 0.5f;

    Porcupine porcupine = new Porcupine(modelFilePath, keywordFilePath, sensitivity);
```

Sensitivity is the parameter that enables developers to trade miss rate for false alarm. It is a floating number within
[0, 1]. A higher sensitivity reduces miss rate at cost of increased false alarm rate.

Once initialized, ```porcupine``` can be used to monitor incoming audio.

```java
    private short[] getNextAudioFrame();

    while (true) {
        final boolean result = porcupine.process(getNextAudioFrame());
        if (result) {
            // detection event logic/callback
        }
    }
```

Finally, be sure to explicitly release resources acquired by porcupine as the class does not rely on the garbage collector
for releasing native resources.

```java
    porcupine.delete();
```

#### High-Level API

[Android demo application](/demo/android) provides a high-level API for integrating Porcupine into Android applications.
The [PorcupineManager](/demo/android/porcupinemanager/src/main/java/ai/picovoice/porcupinemanager/PorcupineManager.java) class
manages all activities related to creating an input audio stream, feeding it into Porcupine's library, and
invoking a user-provided detection callback. The class can be initialized as below.

```java
    final String modelFilePath = ... // It is available at lib/common/porcupine_params.pv
    final String keywordFilePath = ...
    final float sensitivity = 0.5f;

    PorcupineManager manager = new PorcupineManager(
            modelFilePath,
            keywordFilePath,
            sensitivity,
            new KeywordCallback() {
                @Override
                public void run() {
                    // detection event logic/callback
                }
            });
```

Sensitivity is the parameter that enables developers to trade miss rate for false alarm. It is a floating number within
[0, 1]. A higher sensitivity reduces miss rate at cost of increased false alarm rate.

When initialized, input audio can be monitored using `manager.start() `. When done be sure to stop the manager using
`manager.stop()`.

### iOS

There are two approaches for integrating Porcupine into an iOS application.

#### Direct

Porcupine is shipped as a precompiled ANSI C library and can directly be used in Swift using module maps. It can be
initialized to detect multiple wake words concurrently using

```swift
let modelFilePath: String = ... // It is available at lib/common/porcupine_params.pv
let keywordFilePaths: [String] = ["path/to/keyword/1", "path/to/keyword/2", ...]
let sensitivities: [Float] = [0.3, 0.7, ...];
var handle: OpaquePointer?

let status = pv_porcupine_multiple_keywords_init(
    modelFilePath,
    Int32(keywordFilePaths.count), // Number of different keywords to monitor for
    keywordFilePaths.map{ UnsafePointer(strdup($0)) },
    sensitivities,
    &handle)
if status != PV_STATUS_SUCCESS {
    // error handling logic
}
```

Then `handle` can be used to monitor incoming audio stream.

```swift
func getNextAudioFrame() -> UnsafeMutablePointer<Int16> {
    //
}

while true {
    let pcm = getNextAudioFrame()
    var keyword_index: Int32 = -1

    let status = pv_porcupine_multiple_keywords_process(handle, pcm, &keyword_index)
    if status != PV_STATUS_SUCCESS {
        // error handling logic
    }
    if keyword_index >= 0 {
        // detection event logic/callback
    }
}
```

When done release the resources via

```swift
    pv_porcupine_delete(handle)
```

#### Binding

[PorcupineManager](/binding/ios/PorcupineManager.swift) class manages all activities related to creating an input audio
stream, feeding it into Porcupine's library, and invoking a user-provided detection callback. The class can be
initialized as below

```swift
let modelFilePath: String = ... // It is available at lib/common/porcupine_params.pv
let keywordCallback: ((WakeWordConfiguration) -> Void) = {
    // detection event callback
}

let wakeWordConfiguration1 = WakeWordConfiguration(name: "1", filePath: "path/to/keyword/1", sensitivity: 0.5)
let wakewordConfiguration2 = WakeWordConfiguration(name: "2", filePath: "path/to/keyword/2", sensitivity: 0.7)
let configurations = [ wakeWordConfiguration1, wakewordConfiguration2 ]

let manager = try PorcupineManager(modelFilePath: modelFilePath, wakeKeywordConfigurations: configurations, onDetection: keywordCallback)
```

When initialized, input audio can be monitored using `manager.startListening()`. When done be sure to stop the manager using
`manager.stopListening()`.

### Javascript

Porcupine is available on modern web browsers in [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/). The [Javascript binding](/binding/js/)
makes it trivial use Porcupine within a Javascript environment. Instantiate a new instance of engine using the factory method
as below

```javascript
    let keywordIDs = Array(UInt8Array(), ...);
    let sensitivities = Float32Array(...);
    let obj = Porcupine.create(keywordIDs, sensitivities);
```

when initialized incoming audio stream can be processed using the `process` method. Be sure to release the resources
acquired by WebAssembly using `.release` when done

```javascript
    while (true) {
        obj.process(audioFrameInt16Array);
    }
    
    // release when done
    obj.release();
```

For more information refer to [binding](/binding/js) and [demo](/demo/js).
